# Anonymous proxy: fully responsive webpage

This is a final evaluation exercise for the first sprint in [Adalab](https://adalab.es/). The main goal of this exercise was to self-assess my knowledge and skills in basic HTML5 and CSS3 after two weeks in the program.

It's a simple webpage, fully responsive, created using Sass, CSS grid, flexbox, and CSS transitions and animations.

I'm still learning so please, if you spot a bug, want to improve my code or just show me another way to do things, don't hesitate to open an issue or send a PR!
